# Rules of Engagement

## The Board

The InfraSAP project is managed by a governour board that consists of at least one person of each company joinig this project. This board decides on roadmaps, structure and generic rules i(e.g. naming conventions) of this project. The board meets on a monthly cadence internally and with the maintainesi to review progress.

## Maintainer

For each github repository in this project one or two responsible maintainers are elected. The maintainers take responisbility for the roadmap of the repository, they maintain (i.e. ansible collection)

On larger repositories it may be useful to delegate responsiblity for certain tasks to "sub-maintainers", e.g. for single roles in an ansible collection

Each maintainer is responsible for watching, commenting and prioritizing issues, review and accepting or denying pull requests in a timely manner

## Contributors
if you want to contribute to a repository, create an issue describing what you want to contribute or what you are working on. Then fork the repository to your individual space, integrate your contribution and create a pull request.

If you have a complete new idea you want to have implemented, please contact the board and ask yourself if you are willing to maintain this piece of code and get a seat in the board

If you are not able to code, go to the discussion space and leave your input there.
