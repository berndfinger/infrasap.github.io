This project is founded as a platform for open-source collaborations between SAP, SAP technology partners and customers, for unified tools and insights for SAP Landscapes

It should foster the collaboration between those parties for various technical dependencies at the Networking, Hardware and Operating System layers; all disparate efforts begin to join and offer SAP-run Enterprises with greater consistency across different platforms and clearer choice of their options.

The code in this project should help SAP technical administrators (aka. SAP “Basis” admins) and infrastructure administrators to run their SAP systems, by providing
automation of SAP Landscapes infrastructure, OS preparation and SAP software installation with homogenous architectures, which enables the target users to address their challenges without following just one approach from a single SAP Technology Partner (e.g. Cloud Service Provider documentation, or a Hypervisor vendor’s whitepaper document)
